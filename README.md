# Fields of Science
Tab delimited CSV of the current OECD Fields of Research and Development (FORD)Â classifications.

The `broad` and `2nd-level` classifications are from the OECD's Frascati Manual (2015, p. 59). The third column `fields` is added from OECD (2007 p. 6-11) to allow lookups.

The ordering is preserved, though the numbering is not included in the file.
